# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
V. Isualize requested a summary DataFrame is created and analyzed to show the ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). By using Python skills and the knowledge of Pandas the summary will be created. A multiple line graph will be built using Pandas and Matplotlib that will show the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Resources
Data Sources: city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results
The summary report shows the following statistics:
Total Rides (2,375)
-	Rural cities have 125 rides (5% of total rides)
-	Suburban cities have 625 rides (26% of total rides)
-	Urban cities have 1,625 rides (69% of total rides)
Total Drivers (2,973)
-	Rural cities have 78 drivers (3% of total drivers)
-	Suburban cities have 490 drivers (16% of total drivers)
-	Urban cities have 2,405 drivers (81% of total drivers)
Total Fares ($63,538.64)
-	Rural cities have $4,327.93 of fares (7% of total fares)
-	Suburban cities have $19,356.33 of fares (30% of total fares)
-	Urban cities have $39,854.38 of fares (63% of total fares)
Average Fare per Ride
-	Rural cities: $34.62
-	Suburban cities: $30.97
-	Urban cities: $24.53
Average Fare per Driver
-	Rural cities: $55.49
-	Suburban cities: $39.50
-	Urban cities: $16.57

## Summary
The analysis shows what each type of city (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) is charging for rides, the number of passengers for each type of city, and how much the fare is per driver in each type of city on a week-to-week basis. In conclusion we can say the rural cities commands higher fares because there are less drivers in those type of cities, and the distance that the drivers drive are longer which can be why the average fare per ride is higher than in the Suburban and Urban cities.

## Recommendations
1.	Make the fare prices for all types of cities nearer. In order to do this will need to decrease the fare price in Rural cities and increase the fare price in the Urban cities so that they more come even to the Suburban cities fare prices.
2.	To increase the far price per driver, decrease the number of drivers in the Urban cities.
3.	Make changes in prices depending on the city type and the season of the year ie. increase when tourists are in the cities (summer), decrease in the winter time to attract more riders.
